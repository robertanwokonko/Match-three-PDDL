# Match-three-PDDL

As part of my Msc AI program, I presented this solution as part of my AI planning module. It is an encoded model to solve problems in the match-three game domain. Code is written in PDDL language

The result is a detailed plan of how to solve a match-three game with rules and constraints. Search algorithms like BFS and DFS where used by the planning engine.
